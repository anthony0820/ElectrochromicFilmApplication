# ElectrochromicFilmApplication
Capstone Project Application

The team at Southeast Toyota tasked us to design and implement a working prototype 
of a mobile application and control system for an electrochromic window film used in automobiles. 
This control system would allow for variable opacity in the film rather than the standard on or off. 
Due to varying tint percentage laws around the US, this mobile application will make sure that the opacity 
level always stays compliant with state laws. The application will also allow the user of the vehicle to 
control the opacity of the afformentioned window films rather than changing the opacity based on GPS location
if chosen to do so.
